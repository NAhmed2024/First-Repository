I don't have an major plans for this weekend. last weekend, I had a wedding of my dad's cosuin who was very close to us kid and so we played a big part on her wedding celebration. I do have a few netflix shows I'm excited to watch, and a bunch of fresh books I've just picked up from the library. I also have a lot of good food because people are still sending my mother stuff, she had a surgery a few days back and i'm taking care of her.
